Team Project: OPTICAL STORE's DATABASE

Project Overview:
- The project is designed to acquaint the student with working in a team environment, 
obtaining user requirements, modeling these requirements, and creating a prototype of at least 
a portion of the system requested. Initially the user requirements are oral with the written 
requirements supplied at a later date. The intent of this approach is to encourage the student 
to continue to meet with the user (instructor) in obtaining and clarifying requirements. The 
team should take notes and write their version of the user requirements. Once this is done, the 
team should have the user (instructor) to sign off or correct the requirements as they have 
interpreted them. Emphasis has been placed on keeping the user involved from the beginning 
to the end of the project and to consult with the user whenever there is a question about any of 
the specified requirements. 
- To achieve this goal, the instructor plays two different roles. For example, if the student 
asks what tables are needed, then the instructor replies: "I'm just a user. I don't understand 
what you're talking about." However, if the student explains what they are attempting to do 
and are unclear about what they are doing, then the instructor assumes an instructor or 
mentors role and assists the student. However, the question is not blindly answered. The 
answer is supplied referring to material covered in the text and the classroom.
